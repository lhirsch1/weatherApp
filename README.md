This is an app to give the user the current weather condtions and a five day forecast for multiple locations.

The user selects a city where they would like to monitor the weather and they are given the current conditions/forecast, and the city is added to a list of favorite cities. 

If the user tries to search for a city that is not recognized by the openweather API, a modal is generated to tell them to try another city.
